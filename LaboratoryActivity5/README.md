This Java program demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming concepts such as inheritance, classes, objects, and arrays. The Person class serves as the parent class that contains common attributes like name, age, and gender. Both the Student and Teacher classes inherit from the Person class, allowing them to reuse these common attributes.

The Student class adds a student ID, while the Teacher class includes a department and a list of courses handled. The Course class represents a subject with a course code and course name. In the main program, student, teacher, and course objects are created and their information is displayed. This program helps students understand how inheritance works and how different classes can interact with each other in a simple school system example.
