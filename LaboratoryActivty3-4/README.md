This Java program simulates a simple coffee shop rewards system using Object-Oriented Programming concepts. The Customer class represents a customer with a name and reward points, and it also keeps track of the total number of registered customers using a static variable. The class includes constructors for creating customers with specific details or with default values.

The CoffeeShop class is the main program that creates several customer objects and performs different actions such as adding points, redeeming rewards, and displaying customer information. Customers earn points when they make purchases, and they can redeem a free drink if they have enough points. The program also shows how static variables and methods work by tracking the total number of customers and displaying how many rewards each customer can redeem.

This program helps students understand basic Java concepts such as classes, objects, constructors, methods, static members, and simple conditional logic.
