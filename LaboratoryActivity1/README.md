This Java program is a simple library management system that allows users to interact through a menu. The program uses arrays to store book titles and their availability status. A maximum of five books can be added to the library.

Users can choose to add new books, update the status of a book (Available or Borrowed), or view all books currently stored in the library. The program uses a loop to keep showing the menu until the user chooses to exit. This program helps students practice basic Java concepts such as arrays, loops, conditional statements, and user input using the Scanner class.
